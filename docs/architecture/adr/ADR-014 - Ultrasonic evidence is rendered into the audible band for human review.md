# ADR-014: Ultrasonic evidence is rendered into the audible band for human review
**Decision:** Alongside the native evidence clip, ultrasonic detections get an audible
derivative — time-expansion or heterodyne, configurable — stored as a distinct media kind
(`audible_ultrasonic`) and marked as not amplitude-comparable to the native recording.

**Reason:** An ultrasonic clip is unfalsifiable by ear as recorded. Rendering it audible is
what makes the detector's false positives *checkable* by a human, which is the only review
mechanism that exists until a classifier does.

**Constraint:** The rendering is peak-normalised and high-pass filtered, so its levels carry
no information about the original amplitude and must never be presented as if they did.
Levels anywhere in this system are uncalibrated; no sound-pressure calibration procedure
exists.
