# Initial Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001: Single exclusive audio capture owner

**Decision:** Only `capture` opens the physical ALSA device.

**Reason:** Multiple detector processes opening one USB source is fragile, device/plugin dependent, and does not provide deterministic shared timing or retryable windows.

## ADR-002: Highest practical native capture rate with derived audible stream

**Decision:** Capture at the highest target-supported rate needed by ultrasonic analysis, then downsample for audible models.

**Reason:** Upsampling a 48 kHz stream cannot recover bat ultrasound. Downsampling a high-rate authoritative stream preserves both use cases.

**Caveat:** Actual AudioMoth/Linux mode and Pi stability must be measured. Audible-only fallback is required.

## ADR-003: Immutable time-addressed windows

**Decision:** Detectors consume immutable audio windows by reference.

**Reason:** Models have different window sizes, can run asynchronously, and may need retries without reading live audio directly.

## ADR-004: PostgreSQL canonical metadata, filesystem canonical clip bytes

**Decision:** Metadata belongs in PostgreSQL; large media belongs on SSD with checksummed database references.

## ADR-005: No scientifically authoritative composite biodiversity score in v1

**Decision:** Present transparent activity/diversity measurements individually.

**Reason:** A proprietary composite score would imply validation the project does not have.

## ADR-006: Separate model installation and licensing

**Decision:** Do not bundle third-party model binaries by default.

**Reason:** Code and model licences differ, notably for BirdNET model assets.

The following ADRs record deviations taken during the Milestone 0–3 debug slice on the
actual target device. See `GAP_REPORT.md` for the findings that motivated them.

## ADR-007: SQLAlchemy-mediated storage with SQLite in developer mode

**Decision:** Persist through SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic against a DSN from configuration.
Developer/debug mode on the Pi defaults to SQLite at `data/openobservatory.sqlite`.
PostgreSQL 16 remains the production DSN and the only supported target for multi-process
deployment.

**Reason:** The target has no Docker and no PostgreSQL. Requiring a database server to
observe an audio pipeline would break the "repository runnable at every milestone" rule.
No raw SQL and no dialect-specific types are used, so the DSN swap is configuration-only.

**Constraint:** Any feature that requires concurrent writers, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, or JSON
indexing must not be built on the SQLite profile. Retention and review workflows are
gated on the PostgreSQL profile.

**Rollback:** set `OO_DATABASE_DSN` to a PostgreSQL URL and run `alembic upgrade head`.

## ADR-008: Native systemd deployment for the debug slice; Compose deferred

**Decision:** Run the debug slice as a single `systemd` unit inside a virtualenv on the Pi,
with the web UI built to static assets and served by the API process. The Compose topology
of the technical spec is retained as the production target and is not deleted.

**Reason:** Only the capture process may own the ALSA device, and getting `/dev/snd`,
USB hot-plug re-enumeration and real-time scheduling right through a container adds a
failure surface with no benefit while the microphone is still absent. Native execution also
gives honest CPU/latency measurements uncontended by container overhead.

**Constraint:** service boundaries stay explicit in code — capture, segmenter, detector
workers, normaliser and API communicate only through the `EventBus` and window references,
never by reaching into each other's state. The single process is a *deployment* choice.

## ADR-009: In-process event bus behind a transport-neutral protocol

**Decision:** Implement `EventBus` as an asyncio fan-out with bounded per-subscriber
queues and an explicit drop policy. Redis Streams becomes a second implementation of the
same protocol.

**Reason:** Explicitly permitted by `CLAUDE.md` for the first capture prototype. Bounded
queues and a recorded drop count keep the back-pressure behaviour that Redis Streams would
also have to provide, so the contract does not change when the transport does.

## ADR-010: An owned acoustic-activity detector is the first detector plugin

**Decision:** Ship `activity-v1`, a band-limited onset/energy segmentation detector with no
model dependency and no taxonomic output, as the reference implementation of
`DetectorPlugin`. BirdNET is an optional adapter that self-reports `unavailable` until its
model assets are installed by the operator.

**Reason:** ADR-006 forbids bundling BirdNET assets, so a build with no operator action must
still exercise the whole window → detector → normaliser → clip → event path. `activity-v1`
does that and is independently useful for diagnosing microphone and gain problems.

**Constraint:** `activity-v1` must never emit a species label, a scientific name, or a
canonical taxon id. Its `rank` is `null` and its group is `acoustic_event`.

## ADR-011: The debug UI is an observability surface, not the product dashboard

**Decision:** The real-time debug UI reads only from the API and the live WebSocket, shows
raw pipeline state alongside detections, and is allowed to expose internals (frame counts,
monotonic offsets, queue depth, drop counters, detector lag) that the Milestone 4 product
dashboard would hide.

**Reason:** It exists to prove and diagnose Milestones 1–3 on real hardware. Keeping it
separate stops diagnostic affordances leaking into the product surface and stops product
polish being mistaken for pipeline correctness.
